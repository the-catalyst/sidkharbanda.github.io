CascadeXML is an end-to-end transformer fine-tuning algorithm which aligns the intermediate layers to the multiple resolutions of a hierarchical label tree to perform multi-label classification over millions labels in a beam-search fashion, via multi-resolution dynamic hard negative mining, outperforming Amazon's PECOS Framework by 4-6% across 5 public benchmarks while cutting GPU requirements and inference time by half.
