CLIPTrans presents a novel training algorithm for multi-modal machine translation (MMT) that leverages image-text aligned CLIP embeddings as prefixes to the multi-lingual translations model mBART to further the MMT SOTA set by MIT/Google. We demonstrate improvements using only a fraction of data required for pre-training from scratch, with more prominent improvements witnessed across low-resource languages.
