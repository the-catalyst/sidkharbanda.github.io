We develop lightweight CNN-based encoder, InceptionXML, suitable for short-text queries and a scalable framework, SyncXML, for extreme classification over millions of labels that requires less than 2% FLOPs as compared to BERT-based models and is 3-5x faster for inference. InceptionXML in SyncXML beats the previous SOTA on a multitude of performance and parametric metrics.
