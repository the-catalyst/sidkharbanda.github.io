            I am a masters student and graduate student researcher at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) working with <a href = "https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/">Prof. Cho-Jui Hsieh</a> on effective Dual Encoder algorithms for Search and Recommendation. Through this, I aim at bridging the gap between Extreme Multilabel Classification and Dense Retrieval algorithms. I received my bachelors degree in Computer Science from BITS Pilani, India and pursued my bachelors thesis at Aalto University, Finland, working with <a href = "https://sites.google.com/site/rohitbabbar/Home?pli=1">Prof. Rohit Babbar</a>.

            Previously, I was working as an Applied Scientist in Microsoft's Bing Text Ads team. Most of my time at Microsoft was dedicated to developing scalable multi-lingual dual encoder models and training them over billions of query keyword pairs. More recently, my research focus has switched to exploring multi-lingual supervised fine-tuning of large language models aimed at better Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). My goal is to develop efficient multi-lingual conversational search and recommendation solutions to provide users with more accurate summarized search results.

            More broadly, I am also interested in multi-modal machine learning and have worked with <a href = "https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/people/hanspeter-pfister">Prof. Hanspeter Pfister</a> and <a href = "https://donglaiw.github.io">Dr. Donglai Wei</a> at Harvard University on Video Instance Segmentation.
